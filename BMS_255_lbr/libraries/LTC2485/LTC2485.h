LTC2485: 24-Bit Delta Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation and
I2C Interface

@verbatim

The LTC2485 combines a 24-bit plus sign No Latency Delta Sigma analog-to-digital
converter with patented Easy Drive technology and I2C digital interface. The
patented sampling scheme eliminates dynamic input current errors and the
shortcomings of on-chip buffering through automatic cancellation of differential
input current. This allows large external source impedances and input signals,
with rail-to-rail input range to be directly digitized while maintaining
exceptional DC accuracy.

Example Code:

Read input with 1X speed mode and rejection frequency of 60Hz

    adc_command = LTC2485_R60 | LTC2485_SPEED_1X;                   // Set to 1X mode with 60hz rejection
    ack |= LTC2485_read(i2c_address, adc_command, &adc_code);       // Throws out last reading
    ack |= LTC2485_read(i2c_address, adc_command, &adc_code);       // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable
