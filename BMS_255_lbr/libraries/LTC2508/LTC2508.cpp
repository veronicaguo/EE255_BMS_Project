LTC2508: 32-Bit Over-Sampling ADC with Configurable Digital Filter.

@verbatim

The LTC2508-32 is a low noise, low power, high performance 32-bit ADC
with an integrated configurable digital filter. Operating from a single
2.5V supply, the LTC2508-32 features a fully differential input range
up to Â±VREF, with VREF ranging from 2.5V to 5.1V. The LTC2508-32 supports
a wide common mode range from 0V to VREF simplifying analog signal
conditioning requirements.
